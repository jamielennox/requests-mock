  Makes explicit the behaviour of nested mocking.
features:
  - |
    Nested mocks now has a defined behaviour which is essentially a classic
    nesting behaviour. A mock works as normal, but in the same way that
    real_http=True will escalate to the outer send (typically the real send) if
    there is a mocker defined outside that will handle the calls.
fixes:
  - |
    This fixes all known nesting bugs. They may not be perfect, however this is
    now the explicit defined behaviour and so all related bugs are closed in
    favour of this.
