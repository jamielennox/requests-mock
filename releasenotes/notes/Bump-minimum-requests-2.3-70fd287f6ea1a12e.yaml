  Increase the minimum required requests version to 2.3
critical:
  - |
    The minimum version of requests has been increase to 2.3. This simply
    ensures that all documented features of requests-mock are actually
    available. This version of requests is still quite old and if this is an
    issue you should either pin requests-mock to <1.6 or preferably update
    requests.
