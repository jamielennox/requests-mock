    Allow mocking of only a single Session object. While there has always been
    the option of adding just the Adapter to an existing Session, this is more
    difficult to work with than the Mocker workflow that is typically used. You
    can now pass a Session object to a Mocker and it will provide the standard
    workflow but limited to just that object.
