    pytest should respect the `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive` value. We
    read this from the pytest.ini file currently and fall back to a default of
    false if not set. We need to detect if this value is unset and if not fall
    back to the global default. I'm unsure how well pytest handles a
    non-boolean default value for a boolean type, but it seems ok for now.
