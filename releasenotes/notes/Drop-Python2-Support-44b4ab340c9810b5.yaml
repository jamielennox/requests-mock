prelude: >
  Python 2 support has been deprecated in the wider community for many years.
  There have been requests for it to be dropped in requests-mock for a while,
  however it has never caused enough development pain to remove it. It is now
  getting more difficult to package things like six for operating system and we
  should remove it.
upgrade:
  - Python 2 is no longer supported. Please move to Python 3.
  - The minimum version of requests has been bumped to 2.22.
critical:
  - Python 2 is no longer supported. Please move to Python 3.
