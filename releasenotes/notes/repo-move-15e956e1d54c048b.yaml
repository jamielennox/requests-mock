    In this release the main repository was moved off of OpenStack provided
    infrastructure and onto github at
    https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock. OpenStack has been a great
    home for the project however requests-mock is a general python project with
    no specific relationship to OpenStack and the unfamiliar infrastructure was
    limiting contributes from the wider community.
