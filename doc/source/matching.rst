Request Matching
================

Whilst it is preferable to provide the whole URI to :py:meth:`requests_mock.Adapter.register_uri` it is possible to just specify components.

The examples in this file are loaded with:

.. doctest::

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

.. note::

    The examples within use this syntax because request matching is a function of the adapter and not the mocker.
    All the same arguments can be provided to the mocker if that is how you use `requests_mock` within your project, and use the

    .. code:: python

        mock.get(url, ...)

    form in place of the given:

    .. code:: python

        adapter.register_uri('GET', url, ...)

    If you are not familiar with `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/>`_' adapters (see :ref:`Adapter`),
    prefer the mocker approach (see :ref:`Mocker`).

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

.. note::

    By default all matching is case insensitive. This can be adjusted by
    passing case_sensitive=True when creating a mocker or adapter or globally
    by doing:

    .. code:: python

        requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive = True

    for more see: :ref:`case_insensitive`

Simple
======

The most simple way to match a request is to register the URL and method that will be requested with a textual response.
When a request is made that goes through the mocker this response will be retrieved.

.. doctest::

    .. >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com/path', text='resp')
    .. >>> session.get('mock://test.com/path').text
    .. 'resp'

Path Matching
=============


You can specify a protocol-less path:

.. doctest::

    .. >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', '//test.com/', text='resp')
    .. >>> session.get('mock://test.com/').text
    .. 'resp'

or you can specify just a path:

.. doctest::

    .. >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', '/path', text='resp')
    .. >>> session.get('mock://test.com/path').text
    .. 'resp'
    .. >>> session.get('mock://another.com/path').text
    .. 'resp'

Query Strings
=============

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

Query strings provided to a register will match so long as at least those provided form part of the request.

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', '/7?a=1', text='resp')
    >>> session.get('mock://test.com/7?a=1&b=2').text
    'resp'

We can also match an empty query string.

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', '/7?a', text='resp')
    >>> session.get('mock://test.com/7?a').text
    'resp'

If any part of the query string is wrong then it will not match.

.. doctest::

    >>> session.get('mock://test.com/7?a=3')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    requests_mock.exceptions.NoMockAddress: No mock address: GET mock://test.com/7?a=3

This can be a problem in certain situations, so if you wish to match only the complete query string there is a flag `complete_qs`:

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', '/8?a=1', complete_qs=True, text='resp')
    >>> session.get('mock://test.com/8?a=1&b=2')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    requests_mock.exceptions.NoMockAddress: No mock address: GET mock://test.com/8?a=1&b=2


Matching ANY
============

There is a special symbol at `requests_mock.ANY` which acts as the wildcard to match anything.
It can be used as a replace for the method and/or the URL.

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri(requests_mock.ANY, 'mock://test.com/8', text='resp')
    >>> session.get('mock://test.com/8').text
    'resp'
    >>> session.post('mock://test.com/8').text
    'resp'

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri(requests_mock.ANY, requests_mock.ANY, text='resp')
    >>> session.get('mock://whatever/you/like').text
    'resp'
    >>> session.post('mock://whatever/you/like').text
    'resp'

Regular Expressions
===================

URLs can be specified with a regular expression using the python :py:mod:`re` module.
To use this you should pass an object created by :py:func:`re.compile`.

The URL is then matched using :py:meth:`re.regex.search` which means that it will match any component of the url, so if you want to match the start of a URL you will have to anchor it.

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

.. doctest::

    .. >>> import re
    .. >>> matcher = re.compile('tester.com/a')
    .. >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', matcher, text='resp')
    .. >>> session.get('mock://www.tester.com/a/b').text
    .. 'resp'

If you use regular expression matching then *requests-mock* can't do it's normal query string or path only matching, that will need to be part of the expression.


Request Headers
===============

A dictionary of headers can be supplied such that the request will only match if the available headers also match.
Only the headers that are provided need match, any additional headers will be ignored.

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('POST', 'mock://test.com/headers', request_headers={'key': 'val'}, text='resp')
    >>> session.post('mock://test.com/headers', headers={'key': 'val', 'another': 'header'}).text
    'resp'
    >>> resp = session.post('mock://test.com/headers')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    requests_mock.exceptions.NoMockAddress: No mock address: POST mock://test.com/headers


Additional Matchers
===================

As distinct from `Custom Matching` below we can add an additional matcher callback that lets us do more dynamic matching in addition to the standard options.
This is handled by a callback function that takes the request as a parameter:

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

.. doctest::

    >>> def match_request_text(request):
    ...     # request.text may be None, or '' prevents a TypeError.
    ...     return 'hello' in (request.text or '')
    ...
    >>> adapter.register_uri('POST', 'mock://test.com/additional', additional_matcher=match_request_text, text='resp')
    >>> session.post('mock://test.com/headers', data='hello world').text
    'resp'
    >>> resp = session.post('mock://test.com/additional', data='goodbye world')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    requests_mock.exceptions.NoMockAddress: No mock address: POST mock://test.com/additional

Using this mechanism lets you do custom handling such as parsing yaml or XML structures and matching on features of that data or anything else that is not directly handled via the provided matchers rather than build in every possible option to `requests_mock`.


Custom Matching
===============

Internally calling :py:meth:`~requests_mock.Adapter.register_uri` creates a *matcher* object for you and adds it to the list of matchers to check against.

A *matcher* is any callable that takes a :py:class:`requests.Request` and returns a :py:class:`requests.Response` on a successful match or *None* if it does not handle the request.

If you need more flexibility than provided by :py:meth:`~requests_mock.Adapter.register_uri` then you can add your own *matcher* to the :py:class:`~requests_mock.Adapter`. Custom *matchers* can be used in conjunction with the inbuilt *matchers*. If a matcher returns *None* then the request will be passed to the next *matcher* as with using :py:meth:`~requests_mock.Adapter.register_uri`.

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

.. doctest::

    >>> def custom_matcher(request):
    ...     if request.path_url == '/test':
    ...         resp = requests.Response()
    ...         resp.status_code = 200
    ...         return resp
    ...     return None
    ...
    >>> adapter.add_matcher(custom_matcher)
    >>> session.get('mock://test.com/test').status_code
    200
    >>> session.get('mock://test.com/other')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    requests_mock.exceptions.NoMockAddress: No mock address: POST mock://test.com/other
